# Django Blog Authentication System  
*Implementation following project specifications*

## Project Execution Summary
Completed all authentication requirements following the prescribed 5-step approach:

### âœ… Step 1: Authentication Views Setup
**Implementation:**
- Utilized Django's built-in:
  - `AuthenticationForm` for login
  - `logout` function for session termination
- Created custom:
  - `register_view` extending `UserCreationForm`
  - `profile_view` for personal data management

**Code Highlights:**
```python
# Registration form extension
class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):
    email = forms.EmailField(required=True)
    # ... (additional fields as needed)
